# Cloud Architecture Project

This Cloud Architecture project is the final requirement for course DATA-040-003 being taught to Data Science Continuing Education students in Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT).  The project aims to integrate the learnings in the current and previous courses including Data for Decision Making, Data Concepts, Data Architecture, Data Storage and Serving, Data Preparation and Data Delivery.  

This article serves to provide a guide on how to design cloud architecture for a chosen company that enthusiasts who are new to the world of data as well as data science practitioners can utilize as reference, employ as a framework, and help refine.  Major components of this project include the Vision, Cloud Architecture and Pipeline Strategy.

The cloud architecture developed for this project centers on utilizing programs used within the Azure ecosystem, aligning with the technology taught in course DATA-040-003.  It's a design born from scratch, and main references used are the study materials taught in the classes, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and application of the principles learned.

**Disclaimer:** While this article is a personal, individual project made by Shara Vanessa Pineda, it's important to note that the project presented in class was a collaborative endeavor involving Hellen Gaitan Camargo, Lovedeep Kumar Mehta, and Ricardo Freitas Schmid.
